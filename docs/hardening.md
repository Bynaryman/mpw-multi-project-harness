# Hardening the multi project harness

The strategy is:

* harden each submodule with a config like [this one for ws2812](../openlane/macroconfig/config.tcl)
    * the key config is `set ::env(DESIGN_IS_CORE) 0` which makes sure that metal5 is not used for routing

* copy all the gds and lef files to multi_project_harness/macros
    * this is done with [update_macros.sh](../openlane/config/update_macros.sh)

* harden top level macro that includes all the subprojects
    * copy [multi_project_harness.v] to the openlane src/ directory
    * use this [config](../openlane/config/config.tcl)
    * have to modify multi_project_harness.v to add:
        * `include blackbox.v
        * `define MPRJ_IO_PADS 38

* copy this gds and lef file to the caravel user project directory and run the caravel makefile to add the macro
    * don't know how to do this part
    * make in caravel/openlane
    
# Current results for submodules

All the DRC errors reported are of the type

* All nwells must contain metal-connected N+ taps (nwell.4)
* Min area of metal1 holes > 0.14um^2 (met1.7)

Additionally freqcnt has LVS errors that don't seem real. All these pins exist in the design and in the extracted spice file.
